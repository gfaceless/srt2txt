120
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,357
Detectives,
I'm inviting you to leave.

121
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,753
I'm gonna try to remain calm,

122
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,470
but will you do me a favor
and tell me what is up with you?

123
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,792
My guys are busting their asses

124
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,397
trying to hide Walt's money
from the feds

125
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,711
and you're tossing yours
out a window?

126
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,352
And I have to hear about your little act
of philanthropy on the news?

127
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,318
Did you hit your head
or something?

128
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,200
Why didn't you call me
the second you got arrested?

129
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,079
What did you say
to Schrader?

130
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,152
Nothing. Jesus. Just chill out.

131
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,880
Chill out? No.
No, I don't chill out right now

132
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,475
because things
have gone nuclear.

133
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,194
I imagine Schrader shared
with you his recent discovery.

134
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,431
Okay, well, then you get
my complete lack of chill.

135
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,360
Just use the money
that I gave you.

136
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,313
No, Saul. Saul, I...

137
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,510
Stop... Saul.

138
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,037
Stop talking. I don't care.

139
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,716
Just... Just make it happen.
Work your magic.

140
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,997
And call me when he's out.

14
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:34,385
Schweikart and Cokely can come
after me with a restraining order...

15
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,596
...or anything else they got,
I'll be ready.
